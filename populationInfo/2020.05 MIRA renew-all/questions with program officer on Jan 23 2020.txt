"Finally, because of the disparity in career stages between PIs renewing ESI and EI MIRAs, NIGMS intends for the applications of PIs who have had 5 or fewer years of R35 or R01-equivalent grant support (i.e., their first renewal of a major NIH award) to be clustered during peer review. Reviewers will also take the applicantâ€™s career stage and available budget into account when making assessments of productivity." March 13 Feedback Loop blog. If I do a no-cost extension, how does this affect this review process?
